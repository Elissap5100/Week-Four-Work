He had al\nways wanted to come here for\nhis last two years of college, es\npecially since the University had\njournalism and English depart\nments. For a long while b ft\ncouldn’t decide which of these\nfields to major in. He was an ex\nperienced collegiate journalist,\nhaving written humor columns\nfor a Greenville, S. C., high\nschool paper and for the Furman\nUniversity weekly paper. He at\ntended Furman for two years.\nMax came here in 1942 to\nmajor in English. While here he\nwrote two one-act plays, neither\nof which he is enthusiastic\nabout. He entered the Army in\n1943 and was sent to Vanderbilt\nUniversity as a meteorology\ncadet. The professor of the Eng\nlish class for which he wrote\nweekly essays was impressed by\nhis work, so he sent one of his\nessays to Harper’s Magazine.\nThe magazine liked his work\nand told him to send some\nstories. His transfer to UCLA\nhalted his writing for a time,\nbut he sent In the first story he\nhad time to do, and it was ac\ncepted. Since then, Harper's,\nCosmopolitan, Atlantic Monthly,\nand Collier’s have published his\nstories.\nAfter finishing his training,\nSteele was shipped to Trinidad\nwhere he was supposed to help\ntrack down hurricanes with\nradar. “There was only one hur\nricane the whole time we were\nthere and we read about it in\nthe newspapers,” he says. “The\nonly thing we picked up was a\nlawnmower with a bad spark\nplug on the opposite side <k the\nfield.""\nThe Anpy always took a dim\nview toward his writing. While\nhe was training at a Western\nArmy post, he had to hide his\ntypewriter in his foot locker\nduring the weekly inspections.\nTo make room for it, he had to\nstuff his pockets with the socks\nand underwear which ft had sup\nplanted. He smuggled the type\nwriter overseas by wrapping it\nstudio courses; Clemens Som\nmer, art history; Miss Emma\nLou Davis, sculpture and three-,\ndimensional design; George\nKachergjs, painting, graphic,\narts, and graphic design, and\nKenneth Ness, painting, graphic\narts, and graphic design.\nThe department’s, art refer\nence library in Person hall con\ntains 1,500 art books, ten files\nof current art magazines, 11,000\nphotographs, and 200 facsimile\ncolor reproductions. Additional\nart books and publications are\navailable in the University’s\nmain library.\n“These collections are a basis\nfor the serious and distinguished\nwork in art history in the Uni\nversity,” Mr. Allcott said. “For\ncourses in creative art, instruc\ntors borrow books and plates\nfor classroom use, and make li\nbrary assignments.

Broken glass or sharp\nobjects such as knives, tin cans\nand so forth show up as an im\nportant cause of cuts.\n“There are also eye injuries\nfrom such toys as darts, BB guns,\n;bows and arrows, sling shots\nand scissors. Children ingest or\ninhale small toys such as marbles,\nears and eyes of toy animals and\n'so forth.

Gen.\nErasmus Weaver, chief of Coast Ar\ntillery Corps during the World War,\nand sister of Maj. Gen. Walter R.\nWeaver of the Army Air Force, it\nwas only natural that as an “Army\ndaughter” Mrs. Stewart should have\nturned her talents to military uses\nat the outbreak of war.\nAs much of Mrs. Stewart's story\nregarding the military camouflage\nis of a confidential nature, full de\ntails may not be given, but her ac\ncomplishments during by-gone days\nof peace are interesting evidence to\nwhat length photography may be\ncarried in the art of illusion.\nAs a girl, Mrs. Stewart early dis\nplayed unusual talent as a portrait\npainter while studying at the Art\nStudents’ League of New York and\nlater with leading masters in Paris,\nFrance. After her marriage, while\naccompanying her husband in his\nworld travels, including the Philip\npines, China, Japan. France. Spain\nand countries of South America, she\npainted the portraits of many prom\ninent persons of those countries.\nFrom portraiture, she branched into\nthe field of miniature and today,\nher collection of miniatures is of\noutstanding interest, and her name\nis well known in New York among\nthe foremost miniature artists of\nthat city.\ni maue qune a success anu nau\nimportant commissions to paint\nseveral prominent persons when the\ndepression came,” she said, ""I then\nturned to a hobby with a quicker\n'turnover' — photography. Photo\ngraphic design teas a new field and\nin spite of the depression there were\nmany demands by clubs, restaurants\nand cocktail bars for murals and\ndecorative work, and it occurred to\nme photography might be used ef\nfectivelyfor this purpose.”\nMrs. Stewart told how after ex\nperimenting, she developed a new\nprocess for the enlargement of\nphotographs on textiles for use as\ndraperies and photographic tapes\ntries, with delightful and original\neffects.\n""One of my most interesting\npieces of work was decorating the\nOfficers’ Club at the Air Depot at\nMiddletown. Pa.” she said. ""I en\nlarged photographs of planes with\nbeautiful cloud effects which were\nused as murals. These w^ere on paper\nbut the design created exclusively\nfor the Air Forces was printed also\non the curtains and draperies.”\nIn the tap room at the Officers'\nClub at Governors Island. Mrs.\nStewart used old engravings depict\ning the history of the U. S. Army,\nwhich were copied photographically\nand enlarged for use as murals.\nAmong other places decorated by\nMrs. Stewart were the Flamingo Bat\nin Sherry's restaurant, New York,\nand the WNYC broadcasting studio\nin the Municipal Building, New\nYork City.\n""As this process developes. the\npossibilities for use of photography\non fabrics appears to be unlimited,”\nMrs. Stewart declared.\nShortly after Pearl Harbor, an\nArmy officer heard of the process\nand questioned Mrs. Stewart. She\nexplained her photographic work\nand showed a chiffon handkerchief\non which the decorative motif was\na cluster of realistic flowers,\n""The officer took the handker\nchief and studied the effect,” she\ncontinued. "" 'Do you think this\ncould be reproduced in life si7,e and\nof an extensive scale?"" he asked. I\nMRS. LEIZE WEAVER\nSTEWART.\n—Harris-Ewing Photo.\nsaid I was sure it could and, en\ncouraged by his interest, shortly\nafter commenced work on this idea\nwith assistance from the Eastman\nKodak Co.""\nProving that her ideas were pos\nsible and practical in producing\neffective photographic camouflage,\nMrs. Stewart accepted a position as :\nan administrative officer, to work |\nwith the Army on research and ex- 1\nperimental work. Last winter she\nwas the only woman in a class of\n60 men to graduate from the Army\nAir Force Camouflage School at\nHamilton Field. Calif.\nAs owner of all patent rights on\nher process, Mrs. Stewart made her\npatent available to the Army, with\nwhom she worked until a few weeks\nago.\n""I completed my work with the\nArmy this spring,"" she explained,\n“and extended them the use of my\nprocess for military purposes. I\nhope my ideas may be helpful and\nconstructive in furthering the art\nof military camouflage.""\nMrs. Stewart believes her experi\nences in the world of art and her\ncontacts with the people of many\nlands can be put to good use in the\npostwar reconstruction period. She\nis now considering the offers of\nseveral interested groups desiring\nher services for this purpose.\nRUGS\nWASHED\nPrompt ffiM-v- X<il /*\\nlc€. Safe Stor- tJJ J •LtO\n*jre.

It showed a great\nfreight train, 96 flatcars long, 1\nwhich had but one item of freight\naboard —agricultural combines.\nThere were 288 of them in all,\nand the shipment had originat\ned at farm equipment factory\nin Illinois and was en route to\nan Oregon destination.\nThis is symbolic of modern\nfarming. Efficient, economical\nfarm equipment is essential to\nsuccess. The tractor, so to speak,\nhas revolutionized agriculture. It\nis a means of obtaining greater\nproduction at a far lesser cost\nin money and human effort.\nAnd, equally important, it Is\nthe tool which makes possible\nthe type of conservation prac\ntices that will save and improve\nour farm lands for the future.\nFarm equipment is a better\nbtiy today than in the past. The\nmachines, like practically every\nthing else we use, cost more in\nterms of dollars. Soaring wages\nand material prices made that\ninevitable. But it is a fact that\nproportionate increases in the\nselling price of the machines\nhave been generally less than\nincreases in the prices the farm\ner gets for his crops. In other\nwords, a given amount of crops\nwill buy more machinery.\nThen the machines are better.\nThey are capable of more work.\nThey have a longer life. That\nin itself is a form of price re\nduction.\n> PI7flM 9 CiLM\nSUBSCRIBE TO\nnhilv ii n wu ii","az_campfiregoneout_ver03","arizona sun.","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021917/1957-05-30/ed-1/seq-4.json","Arizona--Maricopa--Phoenix","PAGE FOUR"

It is a\nland where each of the follow\ning terms, in some degree ex\nplain what the country was, is,\nand may become, the terms are\nregionalism, sectionalism, revo\nlution, slavery, secession, civil\nwar and emancipation.\nThe United States has been\njustly described as the melting\npot of the world. Its people\ncan describe their descendants\nas English, French, German,\nItalian, Spanish, Dutch, Irish,\nChinese, Japanese, American In\ndian, African, and many others.\nThese people, and others from\nevery corner of the earth came\nto find opportunity, freedom,\nand a chance to work in the\nUnited States.\nIt ts inevitable that there must\nbe conflicts and problems when\nso many people from so many\nlands and cultures mix to find a\nway of life in such a short period.\nIn 1607, the first permanent Eng\nlish settlement Was made in James\ntown, Virginia, in 1619 Negroes\nrepresenting a foreign and alien\nrace came to that settlement. It\nwas perhaps natural that they\nwould work only a few years as\nindentured servants,' latfcr to be\nconverted to complete slave status)\nIn the following year, 1620, the\nPilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock,\nMassachusetts. In time the two\nsettlements — Virginia and Massa\nchusetts became symbols of two\ngreat tout distinct economic, social,\npolitical and intellectual sections,\nthe South and the North.\nAs both sections grew, the South\nmore agricultural and the North\nmore industrial, it was inevitable\nthat only a crisis would bind them\ntogether. Compromises failed to\nunite the two giant forces. The\nCompromise cf 1788 — the three\nfifth representation clause, the\npledge to re-examine the slave\ntrade in 1808; the provisions of the\nNorthwest Ordinance (in regard to\nt. Every North of the Ohio River);\nthe Compromise of 1820 (Missouri\n.slave and Maine-free) and no ex\ntension of slavery North of 36 de\ngrees and 30 minutes; the Compro\nmise of 1850 t which extended the\nconcept of 1820 by making oil per\n' sons North or South, East or West.\nI\nSlave or Free, responsible tor the\nreporting and recapUwe of a run\naway slave, all only defrayed the\nday in which a solution would have\nto be made on the question of Ne\ngro slavery and of the two con\ntesting economic systems.\nFrom 1789 to 1860, except in a\nfew cases — John Adams and John\nQ. Adams, Martin Von Buren., Mil\nlord Fillmore, Franklin Pierce and\nJames Buchanan — the executive\nbranch of the United States wias\ndominated by Southern Presidents.\nAfter 1860 the situation is re\nversed and; only three men —\nThomas Woodrow Wilson, Harry\nS. Truman and Dwight D. Eisen\nhower — ever reached the Presi\ndency from a birth place in the\nSouth.\nBut even though Northern men\nwere generality elected to the presi\ndency in the period 1860 to 1962.\nthe legislative branch of the gov\nernment — Senate ana House of\nRepresentatives, was in the hands\nof the South, even, though in some\nyears they formed the minority\nMoreover, before i860 the Supreme\nCourt was packed with Southern\nmen but since 1860 the men of the\nNorth gained positions in the Su\npreme Court. The above outlined'\ncomposition of the United States\nof North America’s chief govern\nmental branches explains why the\nrevolution, as it affected the Ne\ngro, took certain turns at different\ntimes in United States history.\nApril is an important month in\nthe history of the United St ates.\nApril 12, 1861 the Confederate bom\nbardment of Fort Sumter began\nat 4:30 a.in. Before the last sur\nrender of the Civil War (General\nE. Kirby in Texas on May 26, 1865)\nwould be. accepted the Negro would\nbecome a liberated man who would\nbegin a long, bitter and upward\nclimb to full freedom of oppor\ntunity and challenge and resposi\nbiluw.\n1 O ne-eig:hth of the whole popu\npd*‘.n were colored slaves, not dis\nWr.uted generally over the union,\nbut localized in the Southern part\nof it. These slaves constituted a\npeculiar and powerful interest. All\nknew that this interest was some\nhow the cause of the War. To\nstrength, perpetuate, and extend\nthis interest was the object which\nthe insurgents would rend the\nUnion even by War. while the\nGovernment claimed no right to\ndo more than to restrict the ter\nritorial enlargement or it. Neither\nparty expected for the war the\nmagnitude or the duration which\nit has already attained.”\nI\nINTENTION OF RESTORATION\nLincoln’s second inaugural mes\nsage indicated that his Intention\nto restore Southern states quickly\nand without recrimination is one\nof the great truths of his admin\nistration. The quoted portion above\nand the extracted portion below\n/attest to the humanitarian spirit\nof tne Great Emancipator.\n“With malice toward none, with\ncharity for all, with firmness in\nthe right as God gives us to see\nthe right, let us strive on to fin\nish the work we are in, to bind\nup the Nation’s wounds, to car*\nfor him who shall have borne th*\nbattle and for his widow and or\nphan, to do all which may achieve\nand cherish a just and lasting\npeace among ourselves and with ail\nnations.”\nThe Civil War after four years\nof destruction and construction\nended in April 1865 and President\nAbraham Linccim was shot the\nsame month. One-hundred years\nlater the Negro was not yet free.\nJob, residence, education, social and\nother types of discrimination, too\nnumerous to mention, were very\nmuch evident, throughout the land.\nProgress could toe seen in almost\nevery facet of American life out\nmuch of this progress could be\nmeasured and seen and accepted\nby the present generation of whites\nand Negroes.\nWorld War II of tea- four years\nended in 1945, the formation of\nthe United Nations in the same\nyear, the rapid growth of Russia,\nwith a hope of extending itself\nover all areas of the world, the\nindependence agitations of African,\nAsian, Latin American and other\nunderdeveloped or former colonial\npeoples, the development in prac\ntical religious action ,lhe great\neducational, cultural and economic\nadvances; the Supreme Court, Fed\neral, State and Interstate Com\nmerce Commission decisions render\ned in behalf of the Negro, plus a\ndesire on the part cf the nation\nto m inloin its position as a lead\ner of the West end of the world\nnJ worked in favor of new step\nin the right direction for all peo\nple. The Negro perhaps benefiuec\nthe most, but the United State;\ngained much in the period\n1945-1962.\nTHIRD REVOLUTION\nThe Civil War was America’!\nthird great Revolution. The Ameri\ncan Revolution, 1770-1783 and the\nJeffersonian-Jacksonian Revolution\n1800-1840 were the first and sec\nond great changes in American';\npolitical life before the War Be\ntween the States. Not only was th<\nvote extended but Negroes gained\nfreedom, citizenship, and the right\nto marry, own property uiid to\nhave ia business and develop a fami\nly of his own. To be more exact\nthe Civil War gave the Negro the\nright to be a human being In the\nland of the free and home of the\nbrave, and the right, to have'oppor\ntunity and responsibility for his\nown life and for the life of bis\ngreat nation .\nMoreover the Civil War united\nthe United States for the first\ntime because the destruction of\nthe Confederacy settled one great\nconstitutional issue — the nature\nof the Union. After 1865 millions\nof small white farmers and citizens\nwho formally did not work far\nwages, send their children to school\nor have any real hope for ad\nvancement in the land of great\npromise found that they too were\ncitizens of the great nation. By\n1900 when the United States h.d\nbecome the greatest industrial na\ntion in the world, Americans —\nNorth and South, Negro and white\n— could look back to the Civil\nWar as a 'beginning rather than\nan end of their world.\nGone were 'the pre-Civil Waa\ndays of Harriet B. Stowe and Fred- |\nerick Douglass but all was not com- i\npletely bright for a revolution of\nsuch great change and magnitude\ntakes time. One author put it this\nway. ' |\n“In Mrs. Stowe's day the caste \\nsystem could not look quite so evil\nbecause the American Negro had\nnot yet had reasonable opportuni\nty to show what was in him. The\nracists’ position as of 1850 had not\nyet been riddled by the examples\nof writers like James Weldon John\nson; statesmen like Ralph Bunehe;\njudges like William L. Has tie; sci\nentists like George Washington\nCarver; Negro organi.)»rs like\nBooker T. Washington and Lester\nGrainger.”\nThs changes in America and far\nthe Negro, since the Emancipation\nProclamation, in spite of handicaps\nand opposition, have been great\nana phenomenal. Thousands of\nyoung men and women now work\nand study toward jobs and poa\ni tions in the main stream of eco\nnomic life. Negroes are gaining\nseats in loord, state and national\ngovernment .son merit and there are\nindications that the year 1963 will\nbe a year of new gains, accom\nplishinent.s and of new orientations,\nfaith and dedication to the Ameri\ncan dream, even in greater propor\ntion than any could fairly predict\nten years ago.\nThe nation, except in a few in\nI T\nThe (ten years of Dr. Johnson's\nadministration at Ft&k University\nrepresent progress and a contri\nbution to that illustrious institu\ntion’s distinguished tradition. This\nhas been unique in many respects\nof cultural and scholastic emi\nnence. The loyalty and devotion\nof the Fi.sk Aluimni have no para! -\niel or equal among similar institu\nticns.

These of Fisk are\nso outstanding' that the mention\ning of four names only is sufficient\nto rest the case for Fisk—DuBois,\nFranklin, Ilayncs, and Wesley\n(Charles).\nDr. Jchivon developed at Fisk\none of the most- comprehensive\ncenters of record for the scientific\nexamirrkion of interracial re:a\ntions. Each year he brought to Fisk\noutstanding authorities in this dif\nficult field to conduct seminars\nwhich probed into the intricacies\nof Negro-white problems. The sum\nmaries and announcements have\nbeen guides during recent years for\nthe most perplexing social prob\nlems which have faced the South\nsince the Civil War. These investi\ngations and exchanges had the calm\njudgment and state .manlike leader\nship of Charles Spurgeon Johnson\nto guide the specialists whom he\nsecured for the Institutes of Racial\nNegro Woman...\n(Continued From Page 5)\nthe old Harwood plantation near\nRichmond till the Emancipation\nProclamation brought them to\nWashington.

He is a vice-president\nof the New York advertising\nfirm of McCann-Erickson.\nI\nThe Japanese art magazine\n“Idea” has named him as one of\nthe 15 leading graphic design\ners in the United States. His\nwork is in the permanent col\nlection of the Amsterdam Mu\nseum in Holland. He was award\ned the special gold medal of the\nArt Directors Club of New York\nfor outstanding contributions in\nthe field of television graphic\narts, and later received a simi\nlar gold medal and citation from\nthe Art Directors Club of Phila\ndelphia.\nMuch of his work has center\ned on television, an industry\nwith which he virtually grew up,\nbut his illustrations and car\ntoons have also appeared in\nsuch magazines as “The New\nYorker” and “Saturday Evening\nPost.” He was CBS television\nnetwork director of graphic\naits at the age of 24.\nSon of a Birmingham, Ala\nbama, minister and concert sing\ner, Olden attended Washington,\nD. C. public schools and Virgin\nia State College, where he ma\njored in fine arts.\nHis Emancipation Proclama\ntion postage stamp design is\nstark poster art of a severed\nblack iron chain. “The idea for\nthe design came miraculously\nfast,” Olden wrote. “It was ex\necuted in colored pencil on yel\nlow scrap paper within an hour\nafter lunch with Norman Tod\nhunter (a member of the Citi\nzen’s Stamp Advisory Commit\ntee), at which I accepted the\nassignment.”\nThe Emancipation Proclama\ntion stamp commemorates the\n100th anniversary of Abraham\nLincoln’s action that brought\nfreedom to three million Negro\nslaves.\n-J\nCOMPLIMENTS\nr\nOF\nHERCULES POWDER CO.","msar_iron_ver01","jackson advocate.","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn79000083/1963-11-09/ed-1/seq-32.json","Mississippi--Hinds--Jackson","8"

As he jerked his hand\nback, he saw, coiled in the grass,\na full-grown copperhead, its head\nup and its fangs out.\nHe knew there was no time to\ngive to killing the snake. He ran\ntoward the house, and as he ran\nhe put his finger to his mouth and\nsucked at the poison in the\nwound. But only a small part of\nthe poison could be got out that\nway. The finger swelled, and the\npain became more intense every\nmoment. 01\nThe only person in the house\nwas his daughter Eleanor.

The\nsevere box-like structures that\nhave become familiar in recent\nyears are functional. On the con\ntrary, a design calling for col\numns or chimneys for which\nthere is no use, which are stuck\non just for appearance, is ex\ntremely unfunctional.\nOughtn’t we to take a lesson\nfrom modern architecture and\nmake our ways of living more\nfunctional? Maybe, for example, j\nthe character of men’s dress j\nshould be decided more by the |\nweather and less by convention *\nor fashion. And no doubt it has\noccurred to many people, as it has j\nto me, that in this climate we I\nought to use the out-of-doors i\nmore than we do.""

This departure from\nthe original plan to have the in\nquiries made by the regular commit\ntees proved a surprise to some mem\nbers. They pointed out that the\nstanding Committee on Expenditures\nI the War Department is composed\nof seven members and should be able\nto conduct the investigation effect\nively.\nWmM Avoid Delay.\nRepublican Floor Leader Mondeil\nexplained that It was desired to have\na committee large enough to divide\nthe work among several subcommit\ntees in order to avoid delay.

The governors of Ari\nzona and New Mexico gave their sanc\ntion to the movement of Mexican\ntroops through iheir States, but Gov\nernor Hobby, of Texas, protested.\nBecause of his protest, the Depart\nment has not yet taken action. Its\nattitude, however, in ""sounding out""\nthe border Stato executives indicates\nit Is favorable to the Carranza re\nquest.\nAmericans in Northern Mexico, resi\ndents in territory controlled by rebels,\nare vociferous in their demand that\nthe Carranza request be turned down,\naccording to reports received here. It\nwas their complaints, doubtless, which\nled Governor Hobby to disapprove the\nState Department's request.\nRules by Which Girl Graduates\nMay Win Gowns in Herald Contest\nThese are the rules of the Girl Graduate Contest:\nHigh school graduates must tell the story of their ambitions.\nNormal school girls must tell why they selected teaching as a\nprofession.\nEach girl will compete only with girls in her own .school, as\nthe contests are to be conducted separately in each high school\nand normal school.\nThe writer's name, address and school must be stated.\nThe stories ipust be written on one side of the paper only, and\ncontain not more than 300 words.\nAll stories must reach The Herald office before midnight Wed\nnesday.

WlntrlHrh*m.\nthe House of Commons, proudly\npoints out.\nThis former Liberal member of\nthe British Parliament is here on\na brief visit. While in Washington,\nshe is at 2716 Thirty-fifth street\nN.W., as the guest of Lady Maclean,\nwho is visiting her son, Donald\nMaclean, attached to the staff of\nthe British Embassy.\nLady Maclean’s late husband and\nMrs. Wintringham were fellow\nmembers of Paliament. Lady Mac\nlean is enthusiastic about the tact\nand zeal with which Mrs. Wintring\nham brought various housing, sani\ntation and educational needs to the\nattention of her masculine asso\nciates in the House of Commons.\nOnce, Mrs. Wintringham got im\nmediate co-operation by pointing\nout in a two-minute speech that\nthe bedrooms in a contemplated\nfamily housing project were the\nsame dimensions of the speaker's\ntable. >\nBOin i-»aay M.acxeaix auu\nWintrlngham are warm in praise of\nthe superb job which was done to\nimprove rural conditions by Miss\nEllen Wilkinson, England’s Labor\nMinister of Education, who died\nlast week.

She firmly\nbelieves united groups of farm\nwomen are to become an increasing\nforce in public affairs all over the\nworld.\n""Of course in my country as in\nyours, there is sometimes the feel\ning that women leaders are not\nbeing awarded quite as many plums\nfrom the political puddings as they\nfeel they are entitled to because of\nthe outstanding service they gave\nduring the war,"" she frankly admits.\n“But the fact remains, women have\nproven themselves able administra\ntors, and they will continue to be\nmore and more readily recognized\nin filling of administrative posi\ntions.\nAmong Great Britain’s 18 women\nmembers of Parliament there are\nno marked divisions of agreement\nas to what they desire for England’s\nbetterment and her future, Mrs.\nWintrlngham said.\n""Very few English families have\ndomestic help of any kind,” she\nLOCKER TRUNK\n14-Inch by 31-Inch by 12-Inch!\nVulcanized fiber locker\ntrunks with metal re\ninforcement and brass\nstudded; two draw\nbolts, two leather han\ndles and brass lock.\nSize: 14-in. by 31-in. by\n12-in.

VA\nsaid more than 16,000,000 policies\nwhich will share in the payment,\nhave been issued.\nray menu ny teau.\nThere's no easy pattern a vet\neran can use to estimate his share,\nofficials explained, because of the\ncomplicated formula VA is using\nto determine it. The main factors\ninvolved are the face amount of\nthe policy ($1,000 to $10,000). the\nlength of time it was kept in\nforce, and the veteran's age at the\ntime the policy was issued.\nVA expects to start sending out\nchecks by January, 1950. After\nthat, they are expected to flow\nthrough the mails at the rate of\n200,000 a day. About 146,000\n•veterans Of the last war live in\nWashington.\nThe form, which must be filed\nin order for the dividend to be\npaid, is a three-part card.\nThe first part contains instruc\ntions. The applicant tears this\noff and keeps it.\nThe middle part contains nine\nspaces which must be filled in with\nessential data. On -the reverse\nside, the veteran fills in his return\naddress. On the third part the\napplicant prints his name and ad\ndress. He then folds these two\nparts of the form, puts a 1-cent\nstamp on it and mails it—it is\nself-addressed—tO VA.\nPlaces to Get Form's\nun receipt, va stamps an ap\nplication number on the third\npart and mails it back to the ap\nplicant as an acknowledgement of\nhis application.\nIn addition to post offices, the\nforms may be obtained at the\nWashington VA regional office.\n1825 H street N.W.; the main VA;\noffice, Vermont avenue jmd H\nstreet N.W., and the Veterans In\nformation Center, .Fourteenth\nstreet and PennsyJvatuA^venue\nN.W. ^7.\nThey also may be had at %ie\nD.

He was seen running into\nSixth street.

C. Workhouse\nIrt'Desolate Forest/ to Retire\nLaunched Construction\nOf Open*Air Prison\n39 Years Ago\nWhen C. B. Jett went down to\nOccoquan. Va., 39 years ago to\nstart construction of the District's\nworkhouse and reformatory there,\nthe land was total forest.\nHe’s had something to do with\nevery bit of building done there\nsince as supervisor of construc\ntion for the District’s Department\nof Construction. But on Wednes\nday he will retire.\nMr. Jett, who is 63, took 25\nconvicts with him on that trip\nthat turned into his career.

About\nsix of every 10 violations were in\npublic housekeeping establish\nments, it was pointed out.\nViolations of the hours law con\ntinued to constitute more than\nhalf of all violations disclosed,\nbut in establishments covered by\nboth laws, failure to keep re\nquire drecords is counted, for ad-!\nministrative purposes, as a vio\nlation of the hours law rather\nthan of. the Minimum Wage Law.\nThe violations totaled 1,796.\nThere was a decided drop in\nI both frequency and amount of\n! underpayment, the report re\nvealed, and this was attributed in\npart to the increase in publicity\non the work of the board.\n“The board was more success\nful in 1948 in its efforts to have\nback wages restored to employes\nthan it had ever been previously,”\nthe report said, “with approxi\nmately 90 per cent of the back\nwages due employes returned to\nthem.”\nOf 55 cases referred to the Cor\nporation Counsel for prosecution.\n38 resulted in conviction and fines\namounting to $2,010 were imposed.\nThe average fine was $53.\nFor violation of safety regula\ntions, four convictions were ob\ntained, with fines amounting to\n$300.\nThe report said that private\nemployers during 1948 reported a\ntotal of 30,227 occupational in\njuries'to the Bureau of Employes’\nCompensation.

He said he believed\nthe project will go through “be\ncause the highway department\nknows what is most needed from\nthe standpoint of traffic and\nsafety.”\ni, Called Minor -Project.\nThe New York avenue channel\nization, officials indicated, falls in\nthe category of minor projects\n' not considered necessary for sub\nmission to the full commission.\nAs for aesthetic appearances,\nMr. Root said the little park will\nbe as attractive as ever when the\ncut-in is made. It will have ap\nproximately the same amount of\npark space because H street will\nbe narrowed from 40 to 22 feet\nalong top side of the •park, he\nexplained.\n, District officials said the law\nrequires public hearings for cer\ntain types of major street changes.\nThere is no provision for public\nnotice or hearings on minor\nchanges. Commissioner Guy Ma->\nson said yesterday the Commis\nsioners use their discretion in such\ncases.\n“We could not hold a public\nhearing on every street change\nthat is nfkde or we would have\ntime for nothing else,” he said.\nExcavation Made.\nWhile the New York avenue\nchannel job apparently is mark\ning time pending possible hear- i\nings. an excavation has been made\nin the park.

Berryman.\n“The Great Fire of London. 1940,""\nIs the subject of an exceptionally\ninteresting exhibition which was\nopened to the public at the Na\ntional Gallery of Art last Friday\nand will continue to August 11.\nSponsored by the British govern\nment. this collection of approxi\nmately 80 paintings and drawings\nby British artists, who have been\nor are now serving in the London j\nAuxiliary Fire Service, is having its 1\nfirst showing in this country. From\nWashington, it will visit other large\ncities. The collection had its in- <\nitial showing in London; it is not\nto be confused with the exhibition\n•'Britain at War"" at the Museum\nCf Modern Art. New York City.\nThe subject matter is paramount |\nIn this exhibition of ""The Great !\nFire."" as the artists were engaged\nin recording, as vividly as possible, j\nscenes produced by the blitzkrieg.\nFlaming buildings, toppling ruins,\nfire fighters struggling against\nseemingly overwhelming odds, give\none an arresting glimpse of the\nbombing of a great city. These j\npictures are not comjTOsitions ]\nworked out at leisure in a peaceful\nstudio, but first-hand impressions\nof experiences, horrors and trials\nvaliantly met by men and women\nwhose physical labor in defense of\ntheir country was supplemented by\nsensitive perception and creative\nability. The collection is a mem\norable record.\nBut it must not be assumed that\nbecause of their documentary im\nportance the paintings have no\nother claim to interest. They are ;\nthe works of recognized artists and\nwere selected with consideration for\nesthetic values by Sir Kenneth\nClark, director of the National Gal\nlery, London; Sir Walter W. Rus\nsell. R. A. keeper of the Royal\nAcademy, and J. B Manson. former\ncurator of the Tate Gallery, Lon\ndon. Six of the paintings have been\nacquired by the British government\nand will be hung in the Tate Gallery.\nStill another facet of the exhibi\ntion is its interest from the stand\npoint of civic defense. It is accom\npanied by three London firemen,\nwho went through all the raids\nfrom September. 1940. to last May.\nOne of these ""firemen"" is a painter,\nRudolf Haybrook. official war artist\nof the London Fire Service, who\nhas perhaps the largest number of\nworks in the collection; he is in\nattendance to answer questions\nabout the exhibition. Its civic de\nfense angle is of particular interest\nto Mayor F. H. La Guardia of New\nYork. United States director of\ncivilian defense, who is a sponsor for .\nthe show.\nIn British Tradition.\nViewed primarily as an exhibition :\nof paintings and drawings. ""The\nGreat Fire of London"" collection is j\nseen to be wholly in the tradition\nof British art. The works are, in\nmost instances, straightforward, ob-:\nject.ive presentations of scenes:\nwhich would horrify observers less |\ndauntless than the British. They j\nare undistorted records, restrained !\nand sincere, and (with a few ab\nstract exceptions) as naturalistic in\nrendering as the artists were able\nto make them. Because of this fac\ntor. the collection as a whole is far\nless painful to the observer than\none would expect it to be. The\nEritish have a gift for looking real\nitv in the face, no matter how terri\nfying it may be, and, by this very\nact. removing some of its terror.\nIndeed, the exhibition is a graphic j\nillustration of the British genius ;\nfor understatement. The city- j\nscapes are anonymous, so far as j\nour recognition of the ruins is con- |\ncerned. St. Paul's great dome is\nseen in many of them, and a few' !\nother landmarks; but the stark\n...I\nA BARA Quality\nA BIT\nAKI MUTH\nMATERIALS HI0”.""\nLSTOCKETT\niy SKECO.\n^iiie\n[art\nfelllATERIALS\n4\nSummer Guide to Art in Washington\nThe National Gallery of Art, Constitution avenue at Sixth\nstreet N.W.—Masterpieces of painting and sculpture from the Mellon\nand Kress collections.

They cannot\nbe identified as St. Clement-Danes.\nor the Guildhall, or the Dower\nHouse, or whatever. The labels\nexplaining each work deal chiefly\nwith the artist's record. Nor are\nthe figures in the paintings tragic\nin any sense; they are represented\nmerely as workers doing their duty\nto the best of their ability. One\ntries to imagine how a Spanish or\nGerman or other Europearl artist\nwould have handled such a subject\nas ""The Great Fire of London.”\nOne suspects he would have stressed\nthe victims lying in the streets\nafter an air raid or desolate home\nowners among the ruins of all their\npossessions and similar themes.\nBut there is nothing of the sort in\nthis thoroughly British exhibition\n—no exaggeration, no appeals to\nsympathy, no tears, no lamenta\ntions.\nStrong Faces.\nQuite a number of portraits of\nindividual members of the London\nAuxiliary Fire Service show us\nstrong, calm British faces, both\nmen and women, which go far to ex\nplain the valor of their achieve\nments. Among these is a self-por\ntrait by Paul Dessau, an illustrator\nof children's books by profession.\nHe also contributes a still-life, ""Fire\nman's Gear,"" an impressionistic\nglimpse of firefighters saving a ship,\ndone in delicate grayed colors, fire\nmen in action with hose, and a\ntouching scene. “Sleep.” showing\nthe men on cots in their offices,\nwith equipment, boots, etc., stand\ning ready to be seined at a moment's\nalarm. Mr. Dessau paints with thin\ncolor, through which the grain of\nthe canvas is visible.\nRudolf Haybrook's numerous paint\nings show versatility in tech\nniques and choice of subjects. His\n""Cooling Down Off Tottenham\nCourt Road."" charred ruins sil\nhouetted against a beautiful moon\nlit sky, is done in juicy, glistening\ncolors; his ""Southwark Street”\nseems to have been modelled in pig\nment. so heavy is its application;\n“Dead End"" is a rapid sketch, while\n""Westminster City Hall"" and ""View\nof the City, December 29, 1940.”\nseen in a reddish-brown glow, are\nsufficiently detailed to identify cer\ntain buildings. Few people will give\na thought to esthetic aspects when\nlooking at these flaming pictures;\nbut if they do they will notice the\ncareful baiance of such paintings by\nMr. Haybrook as his ""Thames Es\ntuary, August, 1940."" in which the\nbillowing tow’er of flame and smoke\nis flanked by oil tanks. His “London\nFire Boat Leaving Dunkirk"" cuts\nthe waves in an interesting design.\n""Nights Without Sleep"" is a som\nber portrait of a haggard, grimy\nman in firefighting uniform, which\nvividly recalls the newspaper ac\ncounts of how these firemen worked\nfor incredibly long periods last year,\nfighting their cumulative fatigue as\nwell as the relentless flames. Mr.\nHaybrook is a former student of\nthe Chelsea School of Art and has\nexhibited in Europe and South\nAfrica.\nAbstract Paintings.\nMatvyn Wright is the only artist\nrepresented in the exhibition with\nabstract paintings of concrete sub\nject matter; ""Fire Glow Over East\nEnd.” “Fire Among Ruins” and one\nor two others. He is a recipient of\nthe gold medal Royal College of\nArt. and a winner of the Prix de\nRome. Subofficer Turpin, who con\ntributed a painting of firemen at\nwork, is represented in the Tate\nGallery.\nThe majority of the works are\npaintings in oil; there are also water\ncolors and drawings in pen-and\nink. crayon and pastel.

The mes\nsage is the same, whether it appears\nin a 10-rent pulp edition or on\nparchment bound in rare leather\nwith gold tooling and jeweled insets.\nBut there is as much reason for a\nbook's contents to be beautifully\n“dressed'’ in good typography and\n! presswork as for people to be clad\ni in attractive costumes instead of\ndrab, shapeless garments which\nwould keep them just as warm.\nBest of 600 Volumes.\nLiterary content, hence, is sub\n: ordinated in the present exhibition,\ni having been considered only as it\nrelated to the problems of typo\ngraphic design and production. To\n| be eligible for inclusion in these\nannual exhibitions, books must be\nmanufactured and designed in the\nUnited States or Canada. Under\ncertain conditions, these books can\n1 incorporate one imported feature.\nThe jury of selection considers only\nthe book itself, exclusive of its\ni jacket. Material, design and work\nmanship of the binding, choice of\npaper, type face, legibility and at\ntractiveness of the page, use of\ncolor and illustration < if anyi. and\nrelated standards, are kept in mind\nby the jurors.\nThe present 50 books were se\nlected from a field of 600 volumes.\ni Forty-nine designers are repre\nsented, one of them with four books,\nmany with two; on the other hand,\nmore than one designer worked on\nsingle books.

""Rhapsodie d'Austuriana."" This and all subse\nquent concerts will begin at 8 o'clock.\nOn Thursday evening, in keeping with the rapidly-increasing interest\nin the artistic creations of our neighbors to the south, the program will be\ndevoted principally to South American music. This concert will mark the\nWashington debut of one of the most sensational singers of the day—the\nexotic Brazilian soprano, Elsie Houston. The orchestra will be under\nthe direction of Alexander Smallens In his second and final Water Gate\nappearance of this season.\nWas Kindler’s Conductor.\nMr. Waghalter was born in Warsaw, Poland, but went to Berlin in\nhis early youth and most of his career, until the advent of Hitler, was\ntied up with that city. At the age of 22. acting as operatic coach for the\nnewly-founded Opera Comique in Berlin, he suddenly found himself\nfamous overnight for the sensational way in which he conducted the\ndifficult ""Lakme’ without rehearsal, substituting at the eleventh hour\nwhen the regular conductor was\ntaken ill.\nAfter a short engagement as first\nconductor of the Opera House in\nEssen, he was called back in 1913 to\n! Berlin and given the post of general\n' musical director of the Charlotten\nI burg Opera, the largest opera house\nin Germany. It was there that\n! Hans Kindler, then little more than\na boy, played under him as first\ncellist. Waghalter s reputation soon\ngrew. At the same time, he also\ndistinguished himself as a com\nposer and seven of his operas were\n| produced in German between 1911\nand 1937.\nUnder Mr. Waghalter's direction,\nthe National Symphony will play\ntomorrow night overture to Weber's\n""Der Freischutz.” Tchaikovsky's\n•'Symphony No. 6” f'Pathetique”i, j\n""Rhapsodic d'Austuriana"" by Wag\nhalter, Schumann s ' Traumerei.'';\ni Scherzo from Mendelssohns ""A\nMidsummer Night s Dream' and the ,\nStrauss ""Emperor Waltz.”\nThe enormous talent’ and the\nbackground of Elsie Houston, soloist\non Thursday night, have fused tq\nmake her the rare combination of\nsuccessful concert artist and top\n| flight night club entertainer. She !\nwas born in Rio de Janiero, to which ,\nher lather—a descendant of the\nTexas Liberator—emigrated half a\ncentury ago Her mother is a mem\nber of a family which came from\nPortugal to settle in Brazil more\n[ than 300 years ago. Well armed\nwith the blood of pioneers in her\nj veins. Mme Houston did a little pio\nneering on her own at an early age.\nand went to Europe to study with\nthe great Lilli Lehmann. After\nI several years the singer returned to\nher native Brazil, where she gave a\nfew concerts, and then went to\nBuenos Aires to continue studying\nwith Ninon Vallin, the French so\nprano.\nWhen Vallin returned to Paris.\nElsie Houston went with her. and\nj it was in a recital there that she\n! made what she says was her ""real\n! debut” as a professional singer. It\nwas in Paris that she made the pro\nfitable discovery that her unique\nart was a cafe as well as a concert\nhall attraction, and she appeared at\nthe Boeuf sur le Toit, the Schere\nzade and the Casanova. At the same\ntime she also enjoyed a considerable\nreputation as an interpreter of the\nworks of the French and Spanish\nmodernists—Falla. Satie. Roussel,\nand their contemporaries.\nSince coming to this country in\n1937 Mme. Houston has continued\nto divide her time between the sup\nper clubs and concert halls. Her\nfirst appearance was made at Le\nRuban Bleu on New York's East\n56th street: recently, she concluded\na seven-weeks’ engagement at the\nRainbow Room. On the concert side\nof the ledger, she has sung with the\nNew York Philharmonic Symphony\nin Carnegie Hall and at Lewisohn\nStadium, with the Kansas City Phil\nharmonic Orchestra, and with Jose\nIturbi and the Rochester Philhar\nmonic Orchestra. At the recent\nBrazilian Music Festival at the Mu\nseum of Modern Art in New York\nshe sang several of Villa-Lobos'\nsongs.\nJUAN ARVIZU,\nMexican tenor, who will be guest artist with the Navy Band on\nTuesday evening at the Pan-American Union.\nStarlight String Concerts\nGo Into Third Week\nAs the Starlight Chamber Music Concerts go into their third week\nin the six weeks series, the remarkable attendance at Meridian Hill Park\nmakes it apparent that this unique form of entertainment is already en\ntrenched in the affection of Washington concert-eoers C.

Their radio\nprograms have become an institu\ntion. Joseph Coleman, violinist and\nleader of the group, had a notable\nBritish background before his arrival\nin this country in 1921. He had been\nawarded the medal of the Worship\nful Company of Musicians in Lon\ndon. the youngest artist to win this\ndistinction. He had made his debut\nas a soloist with the London Sym\nphony to high critical acclaim and\nhis American debut in Carnegie Hall\nwas given similar approval. Shortly\nafter, he founded the Perole Quar\ntet which became one of the best\nknown on the concert stage.\nLillian Fuchs, the quartet’s viola\nplayer, is the only woman member of\nany of the string quartets scheduled\nto appear in the series. Miss Fuchs\nI comes of a distinguished musical\nfamily, and has maintained the\nfamily tradition by winning many\nhonors not only as an instrumenta\nlist. but also as a composer. The\nother two players in the group had\nextensive musical experience before\nthey fused thcfr talents with Mr.\nColeman and Mi~s Fuchs, to make a\nquartet praised for its balance and\nprecision.

If there remains any doubt\nof the enjoyability of the music of\nthese composers for others besides\nj the erudite. Victor can banish it\nwith the release this month of two\ncharming works. From the Bach\ncollection comes the “Concerto No.\n5 in F Minor,"" played by Edwin\nFischer, pianist, and his Chamber\nOrchestra, and from the several vio\nlin sonatas by Mozart Yehudi\nMenuhin and his sister Hephzibah\nhave chosen that in F major, No. 34, J\nK 376.\nThe controversy regarding the\nBach piano concertos has gone on j\nfor years with different theories j\nespoused by the musicologists. That\nmost of them are his transcriptions ;\nof violin concertos, his own or those i\nof other composers, is definitely j\nestablished, but why this master\ncomposer preferred to rewrite rather\nthan create is not thoroughly un- j\nderstood- The concerto recorded by\nMr. Fischer is supposedly one bv ;\nVivaldi which Bach arranged for\nthe series of concerts by Teleman's\nMusical Society, of which he was\ndirector.\nQuite apart from its historical\nsignificance and its origin, the con\ncerto is one that should appeal to\nall pianists with a gift for delicate\nexposition and to the public, which\nlikes melodic and appealing music.\nMr. Fischer is such a pianist and ,\nhis recording is a fine one. especially I\nthe mood which he has found for\nthe lovely second movement. The\nconcerto is short, yet presenting suf- j\nficient difficulties for the interpreter\nto be a master musician.\nIn the recording by the Menuhin\nbrother and sister, opportunity is j\ngiven in the choice of the present j\nsonata to judge of the ability of j\nHephzibah as a pianist. The music, j\nas in most of that of Mozart's pe\nriod, gives more prominence to the j\npiano, with the violin assuming ;\nsomething of an obligato role. |\nHephzibah shows herself as an ideal I\n. Mozart player with a light and\n; graceful touch and a genuine feel\ning for true Mozartian idea in\nphrasing. The two young people\nblend their artistry beautifully in\n: this work which, if not so interest\ning musically as other of Mozart's\nsonata's is pleasant music well de\nlivered.\nTschaikowsky's ""Symphony No. 2\nin C Minor.” known as the “Little\nRussian” symphony, has just come\nto this desk, a Victor companion to\nthp ""Third Symphony,” released a\nfew months ago. The addition of\nthese two works to the favorite\nsymphonies is a valuable one for a\nbroadening of knowledge of the\ncomposer's creative ability. In the\n""Second Symphony” the familiar\nTschaikowsky is not revealed until\nthe final movement, where the folk\nmelodies and his interesting treat\nment of them could also account for\nthe added name. ""Little Russian.” I\nThe remainder of the symphony\nhas many tuneful moments and\nsome fine writing, but on the whole\nthe personal touch of a suffering\nTschaikowsky is missing, and only\nthe skillful composer utilizing the\nsame native melodies over and over\nagain for the play of his fancy is\nto be observed.

NW\nFour Universities\nHere Give Training\nCourses for War Work\nU, S. Pays Tuition;\nWomen Attend Classes\nIn Increasing Ratio\nWar training courses designed to\nmeet shortages in essential war ac\ntivities have been instituted by four\nWashington universities in co-oper\nation with the United States Office\nj of Education.\nCovering the fields of engineering. !\n| chemistry, physics and production\nI supervision, the courses are de- j\n; signed to prepare qualified persons\n| for active participation in the war\nj effort, according to Dean George W. j\nCase, director of the programs. Cost1\nof tuition is borne by the Federal j\nGovernment, the only expense of\nthe trainee being books, materials\nand subsistence. The courses usually '\nj cover 12 or 16 weeks, but individual !\nfrainimr mav ranpp frnm 30 nr 40\n! hours, for those employed who wish |\nto advance themselves by specialized i\ntraining, to as high as 600 hours for\nunemployed qualified persons.\nAt present there are 200 colleges\nand universities throughout the !\ncountry which offer the training. f\nDistrict universities participating in\nthe Federal program include Cath\nolic, George Washington. Howard\nand Maryland, which holds classes\nat the Capital Radio Institute here,\nparticularly to train those who plan\nto enter the Signal Corps, in either\ncivilian or military capacities.\n500.000 Trained So Far.\nMore than 500.000 persons have\nbeen trained since the program was\nbegun in October, 1940, with a con\nsistent increase of enrollment each\nyear. By far the largest enrollment\nhas been in engineering courses, it\nwas reported.\nA significant trend has been in the\nincreased number of women partic\nipating in the courses. In the 1940\n1941 school year only 811 women\nwere enrolled, but records of the last;\nyear reveal an enrollment of about\n34.000 women, or about 8 per cent!\nof the total. The highest percentage\nof women are found among those\ntraining as engineering assistants, ,\nchemical laboratory workers, man\nagement of subdepartments, per- j\nsonnel work and safety work.\nAccording to a W'ar Manpower j\nCommission spokesman, the part '\nwomen will play in the wrar effort j\nis becoming increasingly evident. '\n“Women in war industries should j\nbe looked upon not as a problem i\nbut as a solution.” he declared.\nPrerequisites prescribed by the\nFederal Government for entrance to ;\nthe courses demand at least a high j\nschool education, with correspond- ■\ningly higher education needed for |\nmore specialized courses. Require- *\nment decisions are left largely to\nthe individual universities, it' was i\nsaid. As much authority as possible '\nalso has been left individual uni- I\nversities for the choice and institu\ntion of courses most needed in their\nrespective sections of the country.\nDraft Deferment Not Sought^\nIt was emphasized by the Office of\nEducation that draft deferment for\nuiajuecs is not sougnc. Dut tne mat\nter of induction is left to the Selec\ntive Service draft boards. No college\ncredit, but certificates of attainment\nare presented upon completion of\ntraining in the courses. There is\nalso no guarantee of employment or\nadvancement upon completion of\ntraining, but courses are chosen in\nfields where the greatest manpower\nshortages are shown.\nAn appropriation of approximately\n$9,000,000 was made by the Federal\nGovernment for carrying out the\nprogram in 1940. In 194T the fund\nwas raised to $20,500,000. and for the\nyear 1942-1943 has been increased\nto about $30,000,000, it was reported.\nApplication for entrance to the\ncourses should be made through\nlocal universities.\nAt George Washington University.\nProf. Frank A. Hitchcock, director\nof the “extension” program, said 1\nthat since the courses were started\nin December, 1940, more than 5.500 1\ntrainees have been enrolled.\n“About 10 per cent of the trainees i\nare women.” Prof. Hitchcock esti\nmated, He said they choose par- !\nticularly courses in general engineer- j\ning, drawing, examination for flaws\nin metal, topography and radio, I\nwhich has become increasingly pop- i\nular. He also estimated that about!\n10 per cent of those completing the\ncourses have received promotions or\nbetter positions.\nWestern Maryland College\nWill Open 76th Session\nSpecial Dispatch to The Star.\nWESTMINSTER.
