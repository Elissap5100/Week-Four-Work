### Excel & R

**Mini Excel Tutorial**

- There were no issues from steps 1 - 3
- If I did it right, the total sum that appeared was **20780**, and the equation I wrote in was **=SUM(P15500:P15503)**
- Here is a picture of the chart I created as a part of step 3: ![Chart](https://github.com/Elissap5100/Week-Four-Work/blob/master/Chart.PNG)

- After the "Topic Modeling" section in this weeks work, I have to remeber to check out https://senderle.github.io/topic-modeling-tool/documentation/2017/01/06/quickstart.html for a pivot table tutorial. 

**Some Basic Counting and Plotting in R**

*Disclaimer:* In week 2 I belive when we were supposed to download Rstudio through Anaconda, it would not work no matter how hard I tried and played around with the files (following tutorials of course), but this week i am attempting to download the free to use version from their official website. I am hoping it works or I will be at a severe disadvantage for the rest of this week.

- There were overall no issues with this tutorial. Everything functioned fine after I downloaded the "external" version of R and Rstudio.
- Here is a picture of the first chart created during the tutorial: ![Chart1](https://github.com/Elissap5100/Week-Four-Work/blob/master/RplotA.png)
- Here is a picture of the Second Chart created during this tutorial: ![Rplot2](https://github.com/Elissap5100/Week-Four-Work/blob/master/RplotB.png)

- For the last part of this tutorial, we were pushed to try some other simple plots by following the tutorial linked. I was struggling for sume reason to upload the text files to Rstudio in the first place. After some research, I stubled across this link: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/reading-data-from-txt-csv-files-r-base-functions , which showed me this code: **my_data <- read.delim(file.choose())** , which allows me to choose a text file from anywhere on my computer. I simply saved the tauras.txt file to a designated folder and selected it using that code. From there I followed the first tutorial and made a few other basic plots!

- Here are the "Tarsus" plot examples:
